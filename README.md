# MultiVM-Setup

This Vagrant setup creates a multi-VM environment with four VMs: three web servers (`web01`, `web02`, `web03`) using Ubuntu 20.04 (`ubuntu/focal64`) and one database server (`db01`) using CentOS 7 (`centos/7`). Each VM has a unique hostname and private network IP for internal communication. This configuration simulates a small-scale production environment, with the web servers and database server designed to work together for development or testing purposes.
